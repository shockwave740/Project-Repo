**Additional Comments:**
After analyzing and discussing our Miro Board story, we approved of our checkpoints, finished creating ending and are deciding to go forward with writing our story into the story.json file. We agreed upon a naming convention for the nodes and will be using our own branches to prevent overwriting each other's work. We will continue to communicate via Discord if we have any additional questions. The deadline for our respective checkpoints being written in JSON is 6/27/25, Friday EOD.

**Additional Comments:**
We all finished our JSON story nodes, however, we ran into an issue with merging our branches. The merge conflict resulted in an accidental override of our previous commits, which made parts of our story nodes disappear. To resolve this, we met together as a team and agreed to revert the repository to before the problem merge. We then collaborated closely to walk through the merge process which helped us understand the root of the issue. By working as a team, we were able to restore lost content and plan for how to proceed in the future. 

## WEEK_3

**Additional Comments:**
To complete milestone #4, our team discussed the structure of the project and split up the responsibilities for the five main web pages:

- Home Page (Zach)

- About Page (Harumi)

- Game Win Page (Ash)

- Game End Page (Ash)

- Game Page (Scott)

Each one of us was assigned one (or two) pages. We worked individually to write detailed descriptions for our assigned pages, including the title, mockup, required parameters, data, link destinations, and tests for verifying the rendering. These descriptions have been collected in the Page_Testing.md file in the repo.

In addition, we fixed some syntax errors in story.json, such as missing quotation marks around strings and inconsistent casing in node IDs.

**Additional Comments:**
For milestone 5, we came together and designed what we would like our SQL database to look like. We outlined all tables and fields in our Trello card. Additionally, we assigned each table to each user in order to design, and fill out the requirements for milestone 5 (tests, results, status etc)
