### Motivation
We aim to improve our skills in Python, shell scripting, and conditional logic (if/else), while gaining experience in collaborative software development.

### Risks to Project Completion
1. Team members may face challenges with implementing logical flow using if/else statements.
2. We haven't worked as a team before, so working together might be hard at first.
